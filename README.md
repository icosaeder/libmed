libmed - (Not yet much of a) medical sensors interfacing library.
=================================================================

libmed is a low footprint library that implements interfaces of (maybe in the
future) various medical sensors such as EEG devices. The goal is to provide a
portable library with a reasonable abstraction layer over multiple device
drivers.

The library is in the early development so it *does not* provide any generic
interface at this time but is just a collection of implementations.
The interface stability is *not guaranteed*.

## Supported devices:
* EB Neuro BE Plus LTM - `ebneuro`

## Build instructions:
*TBD*
